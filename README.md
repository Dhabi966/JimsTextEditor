# Jim's Awesome Text Editor

## Description
The goal of this project is to build a text editor that runs in a brower. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## User Story
AS A DEVELOPER: 
* I WANT: to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection.
* SO THAT: I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Built Using:
* babel
* webpack
* workbox
* concurrently
* idb
